    * genomics
    * Drug development
    * vaccine informatics
    * medicinal chemistry
    * cheminformatics
    * data analytics
    * software development
    * science communication 

+  Individuals should write a script (using any language) that prints your name, your email, your slack username (with @) and your biostack  
  * Note that we have to have at least 7 different languages. IMPORTANT: Inform the version of the program. Follow below to find yours:

###### Output Template (Your script output should be something like this)
```
NAME: *Your full name*
E-MAIL: *Your e-mail* 
SLACK USERNAME: @+*username*
BIOSTACK: *Name of biostack you chose. The only first letter is capital* 
```
